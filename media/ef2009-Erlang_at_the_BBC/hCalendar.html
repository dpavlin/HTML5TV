The BBC is building a new environment that allows cost-effective building of dynamic content platforms. A key component of the new RESTful service-based platform is a Key Value store - an API which uses 32 CouchDB storage nodes in two datacentres. We have a Java/Tomcat API which handles SSL-based user authorisation and sharding, independent (of each other) CouchDB nodes which are replicated with (replication mapped nodes) between our datacentres. We can also show results from a load/stress/soak test to see what - on our servers - is the long-term maximum throughput of an individual node.
