For well over a decade most storage devices -- ranging from USB sticks to enterprise RAID arrays -- have purported to be a simple, linear address spaces with 512-byte sectors. That in turn has made it easy for Linux and other operating systems to support all storage devices using a single, fairly simplistic I/O stack. Motivated by the need for increased capacity and more I/O operations per second, however, the storage ecosystem is rapidly changing. Flash-based solid state drives, hard drives with bigger sector sizes, storage arrays with enhanced data integrity and thin provisioning features are starting to appear on the market. To truly benefit from these devices we have had to make significant changes to the Linux I/O stack. This presentation is aimed at storage and system administrators as well as developers wishing to gain an understanding of how Linux has been adapted to accommodate new and advanced types of storage. Topics covered will include solid state drives, TRIM and UNMAP functionality, harddrives with 4096-byte sectors, and data integrity enhancements. An understanding of basic storage concepts is a prerequisite.
