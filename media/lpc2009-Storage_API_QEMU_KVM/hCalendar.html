KVM is a Linux kernel module that exposes hardware virtualization support to userspace. QEMU is a full system simulator that runs as a user space process and emulates/virtualizes many types of machines including a standard PC. Together, KVM and QEMU enable Linux to act as a hypervisor.
<br>
As a hypervisor, I/O performance is a weak area today in Linux. Since all I/O for guests are generated from QEMU, we are largely limited by the I/O interfaces provided by the Linux kernel to userspace. The current set of storage I/O interfaces have proven to not map well to QEMU’s requirements.
<br>
This talk will cover how we are currently using the storage I/O interfaces provided by Linux. It will focus on the mechanisms to generate multiple asynchonrous, scatter/gather I/O requests to buffered and non-buffered files along with physical devices. It will also cover topics like request tagging and barriers.
<br>
The goal of the talk will be to generate discussion about proposed future interfaces (syslets, acalls, etc.) and to discuss whether current interfaces like linux-aio are at all salvagable.
<br>
Virtualization is perhaps one of the more demanding userspace I/O workloads available so it serves as a particularly good canary in evaluating future I/O interfaces.
