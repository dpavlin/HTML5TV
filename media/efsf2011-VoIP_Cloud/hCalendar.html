 <div class="description">
We've built an open-source product that automatically deploys, scales and distributes VoIP calls across the Internet on commodity or virtualized servers. It fully utilizes Erlang for VoIP logic as well as relies on other Erlang products like CouchDB and RabbitMQ. It's got an awesome set of APIs and some other nifty features.
