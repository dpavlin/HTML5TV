 <div class="description">
The presentation will cover an introduction into the two popular RFID Standards, ISO14443 and ISO15693, as well as the author's Free Software implementation "librfid"
<p>
The number of deployments of RFID based solutions is growing every day. Still, detailed low-level knowledge of the involved protocols is rare, even within the hacker community.
<p>
The first part of this presentation describes the two commonly-deployed ISO standards 14443 and 15693 - from physical layer up to session layer. It will then continue to look at the typical architecture of RFID readers.
<p>
The second part will cover "librfid", the GPL licensed Free Software implemetation of an ISO 14443 and 15693 host-side stack.
<p>
The third part will look at our current progress in developing hardware and software defined radio (SDR) based passive sniffing of the RFID radio interface. After all, who wouldn't want to have "tcpdump" like functionality for RFID?
