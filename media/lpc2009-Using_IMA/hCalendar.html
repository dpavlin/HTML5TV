 <div class="description">
Linux 2.6.30 includes the Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) system, which measures (hashes) files before they are accessed, and which can use a TPM for hardware signed attestation for centralized management of client integrity.
<br>
This talk will cover configuration and use of 2.6.30’s new Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA). It will discuss IMA measurement policies, use and configuration of a hardware TPM for report signature and validation, and how to generate and use Trusted Computing Group standard formats and protocols for network admission and health-check. The talk will include demonstration of open source applications and libraries for these capabilities.
