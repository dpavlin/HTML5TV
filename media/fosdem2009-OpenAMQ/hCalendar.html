AMQP makes it possible to make cheap, fast distributed applications, for pubsub, cloud computing, telecoms, etc.. I'll explain our OpenAMQ implementation of AMQP, and also our web-based RESTful messaging project, Zyre, which makes AMQP work over plain HTTP. This talk is aimed at FOSS developers with interest in new protocols. AMQP is a good example of how large businesses are promoting and investing in FOSS today.
