 <div class="description">
The video4linux subsystem in the kernel used to be the domain of simple consumer TV capture cards and webcams. But with the arrival of much higher quality webcams, new embedded systems and new HD capture cards this kernel subsystem needed a lot of work to support these devices. So in the past year a new core framework was introduced and many improvements were made for embedded systems such as the TI omap3 and davinci SoCs. This talk will look at how the video4linux subsystem has developed over time, what the present status is and what the future plans are based on the discussions during the 2009 Plumbers Conference. The focus of the talk will be on the new public APIs and the new internal framework.
