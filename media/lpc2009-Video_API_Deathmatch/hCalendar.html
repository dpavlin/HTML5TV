 <div class="description">
This talk is the infamous “Video API Deathmatch: VDPAU vs. VAAPI”, where “VDPAU” is NVIDIA’s Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix, and “VAAPI” is the Video Acceleration API led by Intel, and (not surprisingly) supported by recent Intel integrated graphics hardware, but also supported by recent S3 Graphics hardware. Stephen Warren will be putting on the gloves for VDPAU and Jonathan Bian will be defending VAAPI’s honor. Keith will then moderate the Q&A session, with questions taken from any surviving members of the audience.
