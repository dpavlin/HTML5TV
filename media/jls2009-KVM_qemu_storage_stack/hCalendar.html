 <div class="description">
Utilizing a stock Linux kernel as host OS and a qemu-derived userspace to virtualize unmodified or partially para-virtualized guest on a variety of architectures KVM is seen as the future of full system virtualization for Linux. This presentation deals with the way KVM and qemu handle presenting local storage to the guest, and developments in that area. This includes the various virtualized hardware devices directly seen by the guest and midlayer functionality such as snapshotting of VM images and efficient image formats.
<p>
Another large part of the presentation focuses on kernel issues such as efficient system calls and asynchronous I/O implementations for dealing with the characteristics of virtualized I/O and the integration with next generation filesystems and volume managers.
