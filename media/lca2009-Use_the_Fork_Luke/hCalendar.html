Have you ever wondered "What If" about a project? Ever been one of the maintainers of a letter in the LAMP alphabet soup and wondered what happened if you forked your own project? Drizzle is our fork of the MySQL server. It sets its aim at a particular problem, the websphere, and goes all out to work really well in this environment. 
<p>
This is story of how we forked the project and how we got people to join the revolution. Drizzle is about technology as well as about trying to implement open source practices within a project.
