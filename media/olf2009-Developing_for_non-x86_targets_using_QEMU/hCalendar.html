Emulation allows even casual hobbyist developers to build and test the software they write on multiple hardware platforms from the comfort of their own laptop. QEMU is rapidly becoming a category killer in open source emulation software, capable of not only booting a knoppix CD in a window but booting Linux systems built for arm, mips, powerpc, sparc, sh4, and more. This panel covers application vs system emulation, native vs cross compiling (and combining the two with distcc), using qemu, setting up an emulated development environment, real world scalability issues, using the amazon cloud, and building a monster server for under $3k.
