Apache Derby is a transactional, relational database written in Java. This feature packed database is small enough to be run in many constrained environments, yet powerful enough to efficiently utilize the power of modern multi-CPU machines. Distributed under the Apache License (v2.0), you are free to bundle Derby as part of your application.
<p>
This presentation will give a brief overview of Apache Derby, its history and the community around it. Further, it will go into the details of features that have been added in the latest releases and show how they enable powerful ways to use a relation database.
